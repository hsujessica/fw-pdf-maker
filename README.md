# FW PDF MAKER

To automate a tedious manual task, I created this script that shortened a whole day of work down to a few seconds.

The script parses and checks jpg filenames to be used as text headers and footers, lays images out consistently, and outputs portraits and composites in pdf format.

## Code

- Python and PyFDPF library

## Sample Output (blurred for display)
